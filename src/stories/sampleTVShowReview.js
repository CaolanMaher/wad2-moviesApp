    content:"Visually excellent, the dark broody streets of run down neighbourhoods contrasted with the pastel, immaculate high contrast world of the game, Superbly cast and acted, the characters are well written, their desperation made palpable and importantly, all too believable. Kept me invested throughout with episode 6 being one of my favourite and  most emotionally resonant episodes of television I'd seen in a while. Goes a bit off the boil towards the end which was my least favourite part  and almost undoes some of the earlier good work but overall entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable.",
